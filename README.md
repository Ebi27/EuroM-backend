# EuroMapper Application 
The goal of this application is to help tourists in Europe navigate through inter and intracity transport within the European countries. This app will provide a solution combining information from public transit operators and authorities with live information from GTFS runtime and other API's to aggregate all datas needed to make it work. An app like this must be very versatile and this is the focus. To have everything on a spot; from it being a map, to being a travel assistant, a ticket machine, and a mini transport encyclopedia.

## My process

I will be starting out with the frontend and i have chosen to use [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) a React.js framework due to it's runtime environment. Node.Js is fast, efficient, and flexible which makes it perfect as this app will need to display quick and accurate real live datas. Node.js also uses non-blocking, event driven i/o to offer efficiency and remain lightweight in terms of in-memory usage to data intensive real time web applications that run in various distributed environments or devices.  It is easy to maintain 


### Will be built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Java for backend 
- Spring Boot 
- Rest API to import all of the datas
- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) - React framework
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) - Node framework
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
