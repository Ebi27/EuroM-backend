# EuroMapper Application 
The purpose of this European public transport app is to assist tourists with inter, intracity and international travel within European countries. The app will bring together information from various public transit operators, authorities, and live data sources, such as GTFS runtime and other APIs, to provide a comprehensive solution. The app aims to be a one-stop-shop for all transportation needs, serving as a map, travel companion, ticket vendor, and mini transport encyclopedia. The versatility of the app is a key aspect in its design, making it a valuable resource for travelers.

## My process
The focus while developing is more on reliablility, scalability and maintainability. This has guided the decision of making use of [Nest.js](https://docs.nestjs.com/) to develop the backend of this application. Nest is opinionated i.e has a defined structure which makes it less likely to face issues or errors in the long run.

 Nest.js is more reliable, has better performance in comparison to express.js and is scalable.  

### Will be built with

- Rest API to import all of the datas
- [Node Postgres](https://node-postgres.com/) 
- [Nest.js](https://docs.nestjs.com/) 
- [Swagger](https://swagger.io/docs/)
- [Postman](https://web.postman.co/)
